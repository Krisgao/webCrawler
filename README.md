# Python Based Web Crawler
 As a personal practice project, designed and built a web Crawler for search and download novel on the novel website, and save it in text files in order to read them.
## Getting Started

```
and download the latest verison for Windows, when I download this, it was 3.7.2 version.

## Version
python 3.7
## Running the tests
you can copy the Novel website IP address, and paste on the line 88 :
```
book_url = "your novel website IP address" 
```
and then you can just run this code to download the novel.However, if you want to try this on your own PC, just make sure you get the correct User-Agent which is in Line 8:

    'User-Agent': 'write your User-Agent here'
}
